"Welcome to Mastermind!

Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players.

In this version it's you against the computer - you get to choose whether to be
code-breaker or code-maker.

The code-breaker gets 12 attempts to guess the code set by the code-maker.

Good luck!! You'll need it... The computer is good!

Would you like to create the code to be guessed by the computer or guess the computers code (please enter 'create' or 'guess')"
